>> Raj: You’re wrong.
>> Howard: No, I’m not.
>> Raj: Yes, you are.
>> Howard: No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?
>> Leonard: Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.
>> Raj: The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
>> Howard: I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?
>> Sheldon: Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.
>> Howard: Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
>> Sheldon: I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.
>> Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.
>> Howard: Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass.
>> Sheldon: You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
>> Leonard: Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
>> Sheldon: Agreed.
>> Leonard: I was gonna say or, but why bother?
>> Bernadette: Hey, Raj.
>> Raj: Hey, I got you a little gift.
>> Bernadette: Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.
>> Raj: You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?
>> Howard: Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.
>> Raj: Wow, so you’re not curious at all?
>> Howard: Nope.
>> Raj: Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.
>> Penny: Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.
>> Leonard: Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
>> Penny: Those are Star Trek people.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Penny: I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.
>> Penny: Sorry.
>> Leonard: This is exciting.
>> Penny: Yeah, so, how many people listen?
>> Penny: What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
>> Amy: Can you please pass the salt?
>> Sheldon: Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
>> Amy: Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
>> Sheldon: I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?
>> Amy: No, Sheldon.
>> Sheldon: Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.
>> Amy: According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
>> Sheldon: You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
>> Amy: Well, it applies to you, too.
>> Sheldon: I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.
>> Raj: So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?
>> Bernadette: You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.
>> Raj: You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.
>> Howard: Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down.
>> Bernadette: Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball.
>> Howard: Yes.
>> Howard: Wuh, uh, who’s your father?
>> Howard: Sam Wolowitz is my father.
>> Howard: Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?
>> Howard: Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.
>> Penny: I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.
>> Leonard: Psst.
>> Leonard: I, I didn’t want to interrupt.
>> Leonard: Really?
>> Leonard: Hey, great.
>> Penny: Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.
>> Penny: Really?
>> Leonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.
>> Penny: Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.
>> Leonard: It really is.
>> Penny: Oh, wow. I wish it was better.
>> Penny: Aw.
>> Penny: Seriously?
>> Penny: Oh, my, I would love that.
>> Leonard: You have a new job.
>> Penny: Well, maybe I can do both.
>> Leonard: I don’t think you can do both.
>> Penny: I don’t think I asked you.
>> Leonard: Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.
>> Sheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
>> Amy: Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
>> Sheldon: You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.
>> Amy: Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
>> Sheldon: Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself.
>> Amy: When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
>> Sheldon: I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.
>> Amy: And at the same time, not.
>> Sheldon: It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.
>> Amy: You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.
>> Sheldon: Isn’t that a little juvenile?
>> Amy: More juvenile than this?
>> Sheldon: I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
>> Howard: You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.
>> Bernadette: Oh, let me do it, Howard.
>> Howard: No, I got it.
>> Bernadette: So, Josh, what do you do?
>> Bernadette: Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.
>> Raj: Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
>> Raj: Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?
>> Raj: A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?
>> Raj: You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
>> Bernadette: Why don’t you help with the coffee?
>> Raj: Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?
>> Howard: Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?
>> Raj: I get it. What do you want to do?
>> Howard: I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this.
>> Raj: All right, I’ve got your back.
>> Howard: Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.
>> Raj: Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road.
>> Howard: Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.
>> Leonard: No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.
>> Leonard: Give me back that juice.
>> Penny: What is the harm if I audition?
>> Leonard: Well, what if you get it?
>> Penny: I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.
>> Leonard: From a Kevin Smith movie?
>> Penny: Thanks a lot.
>> Leonard: I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
>> Penny: Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?
>> Leonard: I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
>> Penny: Decent? I make twice what you make.
>> Leonard: Wait, twice?
>> Penny: Yeah.
>> Leonard: Like, times two twice?
>> Leonard: I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
>> Penny: Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
>> Leonard: Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
>> Amy: How’s it going, Sheldon?
>> Sheldon: Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
>> Amy: Can I come in?
>> Sheldon: Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.
>> Amy: Amazing.
>> Sheldon: I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.
>> Amy: What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.
>> Sheldon: Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
>> Howard: I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
>> Bernadette: Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?
>> Howard: Well, I hope I get to see you again.
>> Bernadette: Keep dreaming.
>> Howard: Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.
>> Bernadette: He did it with a robot.
>> Howard: That’s not what she meant.
>> Raj: But technically, yes.
>> Leonard: Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?
>> Penny: In a safe place.
>> Leonard: What does that mean, under your bed?
>> Penny: No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.
>> Leonard: Wait a minute, you have a guy?
>> Penny: Don’t you have a guy?
>> Leonard: Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
>> Penny: Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.
>> Leonard: Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.
>> Penny: Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.
>> Leonard: Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.
>> Penny: Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?
>> Leonard: That would be great, thank you.
>> Leonard: Yes, it is, Wil.
>> Howard: It was actually just a mechanical hand.
>> Howard: You are my brother.
>> Sheldon: Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.
>> Amy: I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold.
>> Sheldon: Mm-hmm.
>> Amy: And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.
>> Sheldon: Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner.
>> Amy: We both know this one’s gonna win.
>> Sheldon: Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.
>> Amy: Come on, I’ll help you take this down.
>> Sheldon: Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?
>> Amy: Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.
>> Sheldon: That’s a big step.
>> Amy: It’s a big fort.
>> Sheldon: Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.
>> Amy: PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
>> Sheldon: G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.
>> Amy: You got yourself a sleepover.
>> Sheldon: Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
>> Amy: Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
>> Sheldon: It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?
>> Amy: Who says this is the only one I hid?
>> Leonard: Hello? What is this?
>> Sheldon: We built a fort.
>> Leonard: Are those my sheets?
>> Amy: Yes, they are.
>> Leonard: Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.
>> Sheldon: Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?
>> Leonard: Yeah, I’m good.
>> Sheldon: Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.
>> Leonard: Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
>> Sheldon: I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.
>> Leonard: Thank you.
>> Amy: Okay, have a seat on the floor.
>> Sheldon: Not there. That’s my spot.
