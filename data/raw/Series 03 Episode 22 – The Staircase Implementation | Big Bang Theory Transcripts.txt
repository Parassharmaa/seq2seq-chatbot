>> Penny: Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet.
>> Sheldon: (voice off): Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
>> Sheldon: (voice off): This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
>> Sheldon: (voice off): No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
>> Sheldon: (voice off): I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!
>> Leonard: Leonard.
>> Penny: Hang on.
>> Leonard: Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
>> Penny: Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
>> Leonard: You heard that, huh?
>> Penny: Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
>> Leonard: So you agree, he’s nuts.
>> Penny: Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
>> Leonard: Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
>> Penny: Oh, I do not believe that.
>> Leonard: You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I’d just started at the university.
>> Leonard: That should have been my first clue.
>> Penny: So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
>> Leonard: For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
>> Penny: Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon.
>> Leonard: Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
>> Leonard: In retrospect, that was clue number two.
>> Penny: Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?
>> Leonard: No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)
>> Penny: Why on earth did you agree to all that?
>> Leonard: It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
>> Penny: Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.
>> Leonard: Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard’s bedroom.)
>> Penny: Oh, my God.
>> Leonard: Do I get some sympathy now?
>> Penny: A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?
>> Leonard: Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
>> Penny: Why not?
>> Leonard: Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.
>> Penny: What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
>> Leonard: As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.
>> Penny: So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
>> Leonard: That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
>> Penny: Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
>> Leonard: It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)
>> Penny: Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?
>> Leonard: I’m getting to it. (Back to flashback.)
>> Penny: Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.
>> Leonard: Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
>> Penny: Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard’s bedroom.)
>> Penny: So, why was it his lucky day?
>> Leonard: Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
>> Penny: What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
>> Leonard: Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
>> Penny: Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
>> Leonard: Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. (Flashback.)
>> Leonard: Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
>> Penny: Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
>> Leonard: So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
>> Penny: Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback. Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)
>> Sheldon: Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.
>> Leonard: Hey.
>> Sheldon: Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
>> Leonard: Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
>> Sheldon: There’s doubt?
>> Leonard: I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.
>> Sheldon: That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
>> Leonard: Okay, I’m sorry.
>> Sheldon: There you go.
>> Leonard: So, we’re good?
>> Sheldon: Good what?
>> Leonard: Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
>> Sheldon: Go ahead.
