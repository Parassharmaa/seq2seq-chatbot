>> Penny: Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?
>> Leonard: I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.
>> Penny: Don’t you want to know for sure?
>> Leonard: No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.
>> Amy: It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
>> Sheldon: Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
>> Penny: Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.
>> Amy: Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
>> Sheldon: You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.
>> Amy: He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.
>> Penny: You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.
>> Leonard: If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.
>> Penny: Really? It didn’t work for you.
>> Amy: Do you think the moms will get along?
>> Leonard: Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.
>> Sheldon: Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?
>> Sheldon: Oh, thank you, Mother.
>> Sheldon: Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
>> Sheldon: What did they feed the lions, Mother?
>> Sheldon: Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?
>> Sheldon: Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
>> Leonard: No, we’re kind of taking it slow.
>> Leonard: What does that mean?
>> Leonard: Yes, Mother.
>> Leonard: I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.
>> Leonard: See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?
>> Leonard: Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.
>> Leonard: Thank you.
>> Leonard: East Texas.
>> Leonard: Hey, look who’s here.
>> Sheldon: Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.
>> Sheldon: Oh, thank you.
>> Leonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
>> Leonard: That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.
>> Sheldon: Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.
>> Leonard: Subtle, mom, real subtle.
>> Bernadette: Stuart.
>> Bernadette: We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.
>> Howard: Hey.
>> Sheldon: Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
>> Leonard: You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.
>> Sheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.
>> Sheldon: Ooh, this is a good one.
>> Sheldon: Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
>> Sheldon: But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.
>> Sheldon: I was a handful.
>> Leonard: You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.
>> Howard: I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.
>> Raj: We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
>> Bernadette: Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.
>> Howard: Kiss-ass.
>> Bernadette: Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.
>> Raj: Hey, I don’t even live here.
>> Bernadette: Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?
>> Raj: I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible.
>> Sheldon: Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.
>> Sheldon: Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
>> Sheldon: Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
>> Penny: Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.
>> Penny: Sorry, I forgot.
>> Sheldon: You remember my mother.
>> Penny: Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.
>> Penny: Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.
>> Leonard: So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.
>> Penny: Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.
>> Sheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.
>> Leonard: We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
>> Sheldon: Oh, sure.
>> Leonard: It came from Tiffany’s.
>> Sheldon: You mean the box, right?
>> Leonard: Keep walking.
>> Penny: Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
>> Sheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?
>> Leonard: Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
>> Sheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
>> Leonard: Yes, you are a super weaner.
>> Sheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.
>> Leonard: Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
>> Sheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.
>> Penny: We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.
>> Penny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
>> Penny: Mm-hmm.
>> Penny: Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
>> Sheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
>> Leonard: Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.
>> Raj: How old is this Jell-O?
>> Howard: Sorry we have to do this.
>> Raj: Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
>> Howard: She doesn’t baby me.
>> Howard: For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.
>> Raj: Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.
>> Howard: You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.
>> Sheldon: Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.
>> Sheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
>> Sheldon: I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.
>> Sheldon: While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
>> Sheldon: Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?
>> Leonard: Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.
>> Penny: Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.
>> Leonard: Thank you.
>> Penny: Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.
>> Leonard: That’s not what it is.
>> Penny: I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.
>> Penny: Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.
>> Leonard: Oh, me.
>> Penny: Yeah, me, too.
>> Leonard: I don’t really feel I deserve it.
>> Howard: That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.
>> Raj: Looks good.
>> Bernadette: Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
>> Howard: Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.
>> Leonard: Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.
>> Leonard: Oh, really? That’s too bad.
>> Sheldon: I taught her that.
>> Leonard: Wow. When does that start?
>> Penny: It’s okay, go ahead.
>> Leonard: Oh, my mother.
>> Penny: Oh, my God.
