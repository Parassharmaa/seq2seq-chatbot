>> Leonard: The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.
>> Penny: Got it.
>> Sheldon: Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
>> Leonard: Nice shot.
>> Penny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
>> Sheldon: Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
>> Leonard: You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
>> Sheldon: Yes.
>> Penny: Who’s Professor Proton?
>> Leonard: He was the host of this great… Hey!
>> Penny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
>> Sheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
>> Leonard: It was pretty cool.
>> Penny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
>> Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
>> Leonard: Hire him to do what?
>> Sheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
>> Leonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?
>> Sheldon: Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.
>> Leonard: Do you remember his old theme song?
>> Sheldon: Of course I do.
>> Raj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
>> Howard: Why don’t you put her in a kennel?
>> Raj: Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
>> Howard: To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.
>> Raj: Thank you.
>> Sheldon: It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
>> Leonard: You’re kidding.
>> Howard: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
>> Sheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
>> Howard: How’d you get him to come to your house?
>> Sheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
>> Leonard: And he wrote him a cheque.
>> Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
>> Raj: Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
>> Howard: You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?
>> Raj: And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
>> Howard: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
>> Raj: It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.
>> Howard: Classy dog.
>> Raj: Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Great.
>> Leonard: Well, I can, so shut up.
>> Leonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
>> Leonard: That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
>> Leonard: No.
>> Leonard: Okay, good night.
>> Leonard: What?
>> Howard: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?
>> Bernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
>> Howard: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
>> Bernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
>> Howard: Yeah, that’s what I was doing.
>> Bernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
>> Howard: Really?
>> Bernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
>> Howard: Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.
>> Bernadette: Where’d she go?
>> Howard: I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.
>> Bernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.
>> Howard: No, I wasn’t. You were.
>> Bernadette: No, I wasn’t.
>> Howard: Yes, you were!.
>> Bernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.
>> Sheldon: I’m getting worried.
>> Penny: Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.
>> Sheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
>> Leonard: Where is he?
>> Sheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
>> Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.
>> Sheldon: Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.
>> Sheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
>> Sheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
>> Leonard: Actually, he’s a genius.
>> Sheldon: I am.
>> Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
>> Penny: Hello.
>> Sheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.
>> Leonard: Yes, sir.
>> Penny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
>> Leonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
>> Leonard: That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
>> Sheldon: Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
>> Sheldon: Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
>> Sheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
>> Bernadette: Cinnamon!
>> Howard: Cinnamon!
>> Bernadette: You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.
>> Howard: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.
>> Howard: Nice.
>> Bernadette: Thanks.
>> Howard: When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.
>> Bernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
>> Howard: Cinnamon!
>> Penny: I think I know.
>> Sheldon: It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
>> Penny: Okay, I didn’t know.
>> Sheldon: Yes.
>> Penny: See, I’m not a scientist like them.
>> Sheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock.
>> Penny: What’s that?
>> Penny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?
>> Sheldon: What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
>> Leonard: Then what is it?
>> Sheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
>> Sheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446
>> Penny: I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
>> Penny: But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
>> Sheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
>> Sheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
>> Sheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
>> Leonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
>> Sheldon: Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
>> Leonard: It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
>> Penny: Arthur, are you okay?
>> Leonard: I’ll, I’ll call for help.
>> Penny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
>> Raj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.
>> Leonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
>> Sheldon: I’ll do it.
>> Sheldon: Oh, yeah.
>> Penny: We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
>> Leonard: I’m sorry things turned out this way.
>> Sheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.
>> Bernadette: Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.
>> Howard: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?
>> Bernadette: It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?
>> Howard: It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
>> Raj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
>> Howard: What?
>> Raj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.
>> Howard: You have her?
>> Bernadette: Oh, thank God she’s okay.
>> Raj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.
>> Howard: I’m really sorry.
>> Bernadette: Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?
>> Raj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
>> Bernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?
>> Raj: Well, I, I thought about…
>> Bernadette: Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.
>> Raj: Sorry. I, I just…
>> Bernadette: Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
>> Howard: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
>> Sheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
>> Sheldon: Want me to sing it again?
>> Sheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
>> Sheldon: Name it.
>> Sheldon: Oh, you’re not. You look awful.
>> Sheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
>> Sheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
>> Sheldon: But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
>> Sheldon: So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.
>> Sheldon: Father.
