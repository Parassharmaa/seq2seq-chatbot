>> Raj: Water Demon.
>> Howard: Ice Dragon.
>> Leonard: Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
>> Sheldon: Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
>> Leonard: Infinite Sheldon?
>> Sheldon: Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
>> Leonard: Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
>> Sheldon: No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool.
>> Leonard: Hey.
>> Leonard: Hey.
>> Penny: Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
>> Leonard: Oh, thanks.
>> Penny: Mm-hmm.
>> Leonard: That’s an atom.
>> Leonard: So, you and Zack again, huh?
>> Penny: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
>> Penny: Okay, we should, we should go.
>> Howard: Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?
>> Sheldon: Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
>> Leonard: They might be smarter than some people.
>> Sheldon: Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.
>> Leonard: A dolphin might.
>> Sheldon: That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
>> Penny: You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. (Closes door)
>> Raj: What the hell did I do?
>> Leonard: You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
>> Howard: No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.
>> Raj: And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
>> Leonard: That happened to you?
>> Raj: First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
>> Leonard: I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
>> Howard: So go apologize.
>> Leonard: Why me?
>> Howard: You started it, we just piled on.
>> Leonard: What would I even say?
>> Sheldon: Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
>> Raj: A Milk Dud?
>> Sheldon: Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
>> Leonard: I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
>> Raj: Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
>> Sheldon: You’re embarrassing yourself.
>> Sheldon: Penny.
>> Penny: What?
>> Leonard: Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.
>> Leonard: Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.
>> Leonard: Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
>> Sheldon: That’s very hurtful.
>> Leonard: See?
>> Sheldon: Milk Dud?
>> Leonard: Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.
>> Howard: Leonard’s buying.
>> Sheldon: Literally? Literally a million years?
>> Leonard: Don’t.
>> Penny: No.
>> Penny: Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?
>> Penny: I’m not happy.
>> Sheldon: In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.
>> Raj: No.
>> Leonard: Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.
>> Howard: Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system.
>> Raj: The Archies are over here.
>> Sheldon: Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
>> Howard: Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
>> Sheldon: To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.
>> Leonard: Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
>> Sheldon: That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
>> Sheldon: I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
>> Leonard: Zack?
>> Howard: He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
>> Leonard: You can’t replace me with Zack.
>> Sheldon: Why not? Penny did it.
>> Howard: Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?
>> Sheldon: Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?
>> Leonard: Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.
>> Raj: But I’m Green Lantern.
>> Leonard: You can be Aquaman.
>> Raj: I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
>> Sheldon: Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
>> Penny: I’m still mad at you.
>> Penny: What great news?
>> Sheldon: Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
>> Penny: Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
>> Howard: She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
>> Penny: Okay, what about your friend Amy?
>> Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
>> Penny: Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
>> Leonard: What are you doing?
>> Sheldon: We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
>> Leonard: You’re jogging.
>> Sheldon: This is how the Flash paces.
>> Sheldon: I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
>> Howard: I’m Batman.
>> Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.
>> Howard: I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.
>> Raj: I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
>> Penny: All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
>> Sheldon: I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
>> Howard: Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.
>> Penny: No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
>> Penny: Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
>> Howard: Well, actually.
>> Sheldon: Don’t. He’s making our case.
>> Penny: Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
>> Raj: Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
>> Penny: I’m not talking to you.
>> Sheldon:  (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny.
>> Penny: What the hell is wrong with you?
>> Sheldon: I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.
>> Penny: Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
>> Sheldon: I understand why you’re upset.
>> Penny: Really?
>> Sheldon: Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
>> Penny: No. Wait, wait, does it?
>> Sheldon: Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
>> Penny: Good-bye, Sheldon.
>> Sheldon: But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
>> Raj: Stupid Aquaman.
>> Leonard: If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.
>> Leonard: She didn’t tell you?
>> Leonard: Who else would it be?
>> Sheldon: I may have failed.
>> Howard: Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.
>> Raj: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
>> Sheldon: Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
>> Raj: Ooh, I call Kermit.
>> Sheldon: I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
>> Raj: Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
>> Howard: No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.
>> Leonard: What makes you think I can convince her?
>> Howard: You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.
>> Leonard: Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
>> Sheldon: Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
>> Penny: Go away, Sheldon.
>> Leonard: It’s Leonard.
>> Penny: Oh. Go away, Leonard.
>> Penny: It’s open.
>> Leonard: Hey.
>> Penny: I’m not going to that party, Leonard.
>> Leonard: Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
>> Penny: It’s not the wig.
>> Leonard: Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.
>> Penny: Okay, look. We’re not really me and him.
>> Leonard: Then what are you?
>> Penny: I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
>> Leonard: Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
>> Penny: You make a cute Green Arrow.
>> Leonard: Green Lantern.
>> Penny: Like there’s a difference.
>> Leonard: There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
>> Penny: Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.
>> Leonard: What about me?
>> Penny: Nothing. Let’s go to the party. (Puts on wig) How do I look?
>> Leonard: Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.
>> Sheldon: Oh.
>> Sheldon: What’s the bad news?
>> Howard: Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
>> Sheldon: Thank you! Thank you so much!
>> Sheldon: No, wait! I have a speech.
>> Sheldon: Stop counting!
>> Sheldon: This is my moment, dag nab it!
>> Sheldon: I’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I’m waiting.
>> Penny: Are you high?
>> Leonard: You’re being a bully.
>> Howard: Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.
>> Leonard: What should we do?
>> Sheldon: We’re the Justice League of America. There’s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
>> Leonard: Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I’m a little warm, so I’m going to turn it down.
