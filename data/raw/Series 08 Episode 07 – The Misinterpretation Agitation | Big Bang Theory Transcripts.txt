>> Bernadette: So, what are you working on these days?
>> Amy: I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
>> Bernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
>> Penny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.
>> Penny: Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.
>> Bernadette: He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?
>> Amy: I think it’s awful.
>> Penny: Why would you say that?
>> Amy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?
>> Penny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
>> Bernadette: Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
>> Amy: I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
>> Penny: Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.
>> Amy: Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.
>> Bernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad.
>> Penny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.
>> Sheldon: No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know.
>> Sheldon: That’s humorous.
>> Sheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.
>> Sheldon: Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.
>> Sheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.
>> Sheldon: Making the extra effort. Good for you.
>> Leonard: Great timing, food just got here.
>> Sheldon: Ooh, Siam Palace?
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Sheldon: Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Sheldon: Uh, extra peanut sauce?
>> Leonard: No, but you can have mine.
>> Sheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.
>> Leonard: What? Why didn’t you say that first?
>> Sheldon: Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
>> Leonard: Can I help you?
>> Leonard: May I ask why?
>> Leonard: Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you.
>> Leonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.
>> Raj: Really?
>> Leonard: I think so.
>> Leonard: Excuse me?
>> Leonard: Thank you. Sorry.
>> Sheldon: Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.
>> Leonard: He tried to score with Penny.
>> Sheldon: So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.
>> Amy: So, how was work today?
>> Bernadette: It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.
>> Amy: What happened?
>> Bernadette: I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.
>> Amy: Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.
>> Bernadette: I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here.
>> Amy: Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.
>> Bernadette: What? How?
>> Amy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
>> Bernadette: Amy, what did you say?
>> Amy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.
>> Bernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.
>> Amy: Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.
>> Bernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.
>> Amy: But it was bad publicity.
>> Bernadette: That’s for me to decide, not you.
>> Amy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.
>> Bernadette: And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line.
>> Amy: You have a nice night.
>> Bernadette: Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.
>> Sheldon: Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.
>> Raj: Oh, cool.
>> Howard: How’d you get that?
>> Howard: Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.
>> Leonard: That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
>> Sheldon: What’d you get? What’d you get?
>> Raj: I would love to see your collection.
>> Howard: We know.
>> Raj: Preach.
>> Leonard: Sure.
>> Leonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.
>> Sheldon: Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.
>> Leonard: I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.
>> Howard: A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
>> Leonard: Can we please change the subject?
>> Penny: Hi.
>> Raj: Well, that didn’t go your way.
>> Penny: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?
>> Penny: Really? Why?
>> Leonard: Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.
>> Sheldon: Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.
>> Penny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.
>> Penny: Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.
>> Leonard: Can we talk in private?
>> Penny: Please, yes.
>> Leonard: I’ll be right back.
>> Sheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
>> Leonard: So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?
>> Penny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.
>> Leonard: Why?
>> Penny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?
>> Leonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.
>> Penny: You were okay with that?
>> Leonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.
>> Penny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?
>> Leonard: A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy.
>> Penny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.
>> Leonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
>> Penny: I can’t do it, he’s my best client.
>> Leonard: All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.
>> Raj: Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?
>> Leonard: Yeah, sure. You owe me.
>> Leonard: Oh, my God.
>> Sheldon: Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.
>> Howard: Oh, come on. It’s a replica.
>> Howard: Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.
>> Raj: The gun from Hellboy?
>> Raj: How did you get it?
>> Raj: Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.
>> Howard: Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?
>> Raj: Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond.
>> Leonard: Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
>> Sheldon: Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?
>> Leonard: No, because I liked it.
>> Sheldon: Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.
>> Sheldon: Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.
>> Sheldon: Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased.
>> Sheldon: Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.
>> Leonard: What?
>> Sheldon: I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
>> Amy: Nice flowers.
>> Amy: Isn’t she lucky?
>> Amy: What’s that?
>> Amy: I guess that’s all anybody wants.
>> Amy: Well, I hope you get it.
>> Leonard: Next game, let’s switch helmets.
>> Sheldon: No, I’d look silly in that helmet.
>> Amy: I can’t take these.
>> Amy: But what about the other girl?
>> Penny: Dr. Lorvis?
>> Raj: You think he bites?
>> Howard: Stick your head in there and find out.
>> Raj: You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
>> Leonard: I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.
>> Raj: Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
>> Howard: It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.
>> Raj: Okay, now you’re messing with me.
>> Leonard: Uh, guys, we’re locked in here.
>> Sheldon: Oh, this day just keeps getting better.
>> Penny: So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?
>> Amy: We all have a past.
>> Penny: Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy.
>> Penny: Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you.
>> Penny: Okay, so how do they unstick it?
>> Penny: Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.
>> Penny: Move it.
>> Bernadette: Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry.
>> Amy: That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
>> Bernadette: What?
>> Penny: Just walk.
>> Sheldon: You can do this.
>> Raj: One ladder left.
>> Leonard: Oh-hom yeah.
>> Howard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Next level.
>> Penny: Leonard, are you okay?
>> Leonard: Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
>> Amy: Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?
>> Howard: Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.
>> Leonard: Got it.
>> Penny: Okay, Leonard, let’s go.
>> Leonard: Just hang on.
>> Amy: Sure.
>> Penny: Yeah.
