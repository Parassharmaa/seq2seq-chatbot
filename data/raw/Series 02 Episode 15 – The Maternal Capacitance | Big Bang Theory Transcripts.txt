>> Penny: Fellas, please.
>> Howard: Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.
>> Penny: You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
>> Penny: What’s that about?
>> Howard: Not a clue.
>> Leonard: Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
>> Sheldon: This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.
>> Leonard: No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
>> Sheldon: He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
>> Leonard: Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable.
>> Sheldon: Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.
>> Leonard: Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.
>> Howard: How about that, you were right.
>> Penny: It’s out of order.
>> Penny: I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
>> Penny: You must be Leonard’s mother.
>> Penny: Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.
>> Penny: Oh, nice to meet you.
>> Penny: Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.
>> Penny: Yeah, sure, I guess.
>> Penny: Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?
>> Penny: Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
>> Penny: Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.
>> Penny: Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
>> Penny: Oh, well, I’m an actress.
>> Penny: What do you mean why?
>> Penny: Yeah, I don’t know what that means.
>> Penny: Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
>> Penny: I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!
>> Penny: Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!
>> Leonard: Good to see you, Mother.
>> Leonard: Here’s your tea, Mother.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: Yes.
>> Leonard: I’ll start again.
>> Sheldon: I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
>> Sheldon: That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
>> Sheldon: Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
>> Leonard: Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
>> Sheldon: The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
>> Leonard: Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
>> Sheldon: Aw…
>> Leonard: So, Mother, what’s new?
>> Leonard: All right. Uh, what’s new with you?
>> Leonard: Maybe something less personal.
>> Leonard: Oh, my God. What happened?
>> Sheldon: What a remarkable woman.
>> Leonard: Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
>> Sheldon: I envy you your childhood.
>> Leonard: I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
>> Sheldon: You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.
>> Leonard: Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
>> Sheldon: You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.
>> Howard: So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.
>> Leonard: Please, don’t go there, Howard.
>> Howard: I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields.
>> Leonard: Boy, you suck.
>> Howard: So, she’s close to curing diabetes?
>> Howard: Wow, you must be very proud.
>> Leonard: Why are you doing this?
>> Howard: You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.
>> Sheldon: Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
>> Raj: Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
>> Howard: Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.
>> Leonard: You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
>> Raj: Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.
>> Howard: Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?
>> Leonard: That was fast.
>> Sheldon: It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location.
>> Leonard: Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
>> Howard: It’s just temporary, I pay rent.
>> Leonard: He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
>> Howard: Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That’s basically what I just said.
>> Leonard: You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
>> Leonard: There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
>> Sheldon: Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
>> Leonard: Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
>> Leonard: No.
>> Howard: Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.
>> Raj: Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?
>> Howard: Why is it always my responsibility?
>> Raj: It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
>> Howard: I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
>> Raj: I didn’t bring it up. You did.
>> Howard: We’ll talk about this later.
>> Raj: You always say that, but we never do.
>> Sheldon: You went to the comic book store without me.7
>> Penny: Hey.
>> Leonard: You got alcohol?
>> Penny: Your mom still here?
>> Leonard: Yep.
>> Penny: Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?
>> Leonard: Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
>> Penny: Oh, my God. What happened?
>> Leonard: Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
>> Penny: Geez, what a fun couple.
>> Leonard: She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
>> Penny: Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.
>> Leonard: You can’t let her get into your head.
>> Penny: My head, what about yours?
>> Leonard: It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
>> Penny: She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
>> Leonard: Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.
>> Penny: I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?
>> Leonard: Did you get the part?
>> Penny: No, they said I was too perky.
>> Leonard: Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
>> Penny: Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me.
>> Leonard: Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
>> Penny: A hugging machine?
>> Leonard: Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
>> Penny: Oh, that is so sad.
>> Leonard: You know what the saddest part was?
>> Penny: What?
>> Leonard: My father used to borrow it.
>> Sheldon: I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
>> Sheldon: I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
>> Sheldon: Oh, I can’t believe that.
>> Sheldon: My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
>> Sheldon: Can I make you a cup of tea?
>> Sheldon: I feel very comfortable around you.
>> Sheldon: It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.
>> Sheldon: What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
>> Sheldon: I’d like to do the math.
>> Penny: Okay, now this time…
>> Leonard: Uh-huh.
>> Penny: You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.
>> Leonard: I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.
>> Penny: Neck, shot, lime. (Leonard starts licking her neck. He is there a long time) Okay, shot, lime.
>> Leonard: Right. Ah! Where’s the lime? (Penny has the lime in her mouth) Oh, okay, we’re sharing.
>> Sheldon: So, what do you think?
>> Sheldon: Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.
>> Sheldon: I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.
>> Sheldon: You see right through me, don’t you?
>> Leonard: This is actually gonna happen.
>> Penny: Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
>> Leonard: You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children.
>> Penny: Why would you bring that up right now?
>> Leonard: I don’t know. Foreplay?
>> Penny: So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?
>> Leonard: Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”
>> Penny: That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
>> Leonard: Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that.
>> Penny: Get out!
>> Leonard: She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey’s “Any Way You Want It” on Rock Star.)
>> Leonard: All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.
>> Leonard: Morning.
>> Penny: Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.
>> Leonard: You don’t have to. Ever.
>> Penny: Gotcha.
>> Leonard: Good-bye, Mother.
>> Penny: Would it help?
