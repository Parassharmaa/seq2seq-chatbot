>> Leonard: Hey, ready for lunch?
>> Howard: Oh, one sec.
>> Sheldon: Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
>> Howard: No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.
>> Leonard: That’ll teach her to care about your health.
>> Howard: Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.
>> Raj: When was the last actual exercise you got?
>> Howard: The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.
>> Sheldon: According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.
>> Raj: Are you?
>> Sheldon: Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.
>> Leonard: It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
>> Howard: You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.
>> Leonard: Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.
>> Sheldon: Had me at flag, lost me at football.
>> Penny: Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
>> Leonard: What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
>> Penny: Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
>> Leonard: I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
>> Sheldon: Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
>> Leonard: It’s indoors, so no sunscreen.
>> Sheldon: No throwing, no catching, no running.
>> Leonard: No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
>> Sheldon: Or worse, up.
>> Leonard: Preach.
>> Sheldon: And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.
>> Leonard: What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
>> Sheldon: Ah, touché.
>> Bernadette: Sure. So how can we help?
>> Penny: All right, well, what have you tried so far?
>> Penny: Really? In a comic book store?
>> Amy: Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.
>> Raj: I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
>> Leonard: I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
>> Sheldon: Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have.
>> Raj: We can still be swashers.
>> Howard: Well said, Puss.
>> Leonard: That’s not why we’re here.
>> Raj: Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.
>> Howard: And maybe a little Princess Bride.
>> Raj: Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.
>> Sheldon: We’re not afraid of physical activity.
>> Howard: Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
>> Sheldon: Oh, dear.
>> Sheldon: Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.
>> Howard: When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
>> Sheldon: Right. Always right.
>> Howard: He’s a righty.
>> Howard: Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.
>> Leonard: This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.
>> Sheldon: Excuse me, Barry?
>> Sheldon: When can I stab one of my friends?
>> Sheldon: Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.
>> Amy: Have you thought about advertising directly to females?
>> Penny: Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?
>> Penny: All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.
>> Raj: Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
>> Sheldon: En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.
>> Howard: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
>> Raj: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
>> Howard: I thought you were Puss in Boots.
>> Raj: Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
>> Sheldon: I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
>> Leonard: What?
>> Sheldon: You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
>> Leonard: When was your honour insulted?
>> Sheldon: My last physical.
>> Leonard: Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.
>> Raj: My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
>> Howard: My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
>> Sheldon: Ah, this is fun.
>> Leonard: Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.
>> Sheldon: Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.
>> Sheldon: Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?
>> Leonard: Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.
>> Sheldon: Well, that’s unacceptable.
>> Leonard: Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.
>> Sheldon: Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.
>> Leonard: Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.
>> Sheldon: You really think so?
>> Leonard: Of course. She deserves to be happy.
>> Sheldon: How dare you.
>> Leonard: Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.
>> Sheldon: Barry, a word?
>> Leonard: And now the crazy version of what I just said.
>> Sheldon: If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.
>> Sheldon: By challenging you to a duel.
>> Sheldon: That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.
>> Leonard: Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.
>> Penny: Yeah.
>> Bernadette: You are.
>> Amy: You can say it.
>> Penny: Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.
>> Amy: Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
>> Bernadette: Was it?
>> Penny: Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
>> Bernadette: That really happened?
>> Amy: Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
>> Amy: Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.
>> Leonard: I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.
>> Sheldon: Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.
>> Leonard: If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.
>> Howard: Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.
>> Sheldon: That’s ridiculous.
>> Raj: Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.
>> Sheldon: True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.
>> Leonard: Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
>> Sheldon: There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.
>> Raj: Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.
>> Sheldon: You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
>> Raj: How many sips of that beer did he have?
>> Leonard: Three.
>> Howard: Oh, boy.
>> Sheldon: Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.
>> Sheldon: It’s a Pokémon reference.
>> Sheldon: Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?
>> Sheldon: Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.
>> Bernadette: Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
>> Penny: Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
>> Amy: I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.
>> Bernadette: Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.
>> Penny: And sometimes we marry them anyway.
>> Penny: What?
>> Amy: Barry Kripke just asked me out.
>> Bernadette: Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.
>> Penny: I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
>> Bernadette: What did he say?
>> Amy: Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.
>> Penny: Well, what are you gonna do?
>> Amy: I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.
>> Bernadette: What can it hurt?
>> Amy: Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.
>> Bernadette: You mean, not a scientist?
>> Penny: I think she means not a weirdo.
>> Bernadette: Are you attracted to him?
>> Amy: I don’t know.
>> Penny: All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?
>> Amy: Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.
>> Sheldon: I smell funny. I taste salty.
>> Leonard: You’re just sweaty from exercise.
>> Sheldon: And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
>> Leonard: I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
>> Amy: Hello.
>> Sheldon: Hello.
>> Leonard: We should let you guys talk.
>> Bernadette: Yeah.
>> Sheldon: You don’t have to leave.
>> Leonard: Look at me go.
>> Amy: Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.
>> Bernadette: Walk.
>> Amy: How have you been?
>> Sheldon: I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.
>> Amy: How’d that go?
>> Sheldon: It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
>> Amy: Well, actually, he, he already did.
>> Sheldon: Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.
>> Amy: I said no.
>> Sheldon: Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
>> Amy: I didn’t know you were interested in dating.
>> Sheldon: I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
>> Amy: Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good.
>> Sheldon: Thanks. And I taste good too.
>> Bernadette: Howie?
>> Howard: What’s up?
>> Bernadette: Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
