>> Sheldon: Leonard? Leonard?
>> Leonard: What?
>> Sheldon: You realize you and I could become brothers.
>> Leonard: We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
>> Sheldon: I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
>> Leonard: Go to sleep.
>> Sheldon: Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
>> Leonard: No.
>> Sheldon: Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
>> Penny: Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
>> Sheldon: Very well.
>> Leonard: I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
>> Penny: God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
>> Sheldon: Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.
>> Penny: Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.
>> Leonard: Yeah, drive safe. 
>> Penny: Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
>> Sheldon: It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
>> Penny: What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.
>> Penny: Why?
>> Leonard: Well, why? What’s wrong?
>> Sheldon: Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?
>> Sheldon: Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
>> Sheldon: Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?
>> Sheldon: Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.
>> Penny: Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. 
>> Sheldon: And turned their phones off.
>> Leonard: Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
>> Penny: Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.
>> Sheldon: You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
>> Raj: It is funny when you think about it.
>> Howard: Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
>> Bernadette: Because you were driving like a lunatic.
>> Howard: Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.
>> Bernadette: It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
>> Howard: I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
>> Raj: Hello.
>> Raj: Howard Wolowitz?
>> Raj: Address?
>> Raj: Um, no. 
>> Raj: May I ask what this is about?
>> Raj: Very well.
>> Raj: Okay.
>> Raj: That’s not him.
>> Penny: Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
>> Penny: Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
>> Penny: What?
>> Penny: Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…
>> Penny: So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
>> Howard: That’s great, now they know where I live.
>> Raj: What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
>> Bernadette: Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.
>> Raj: Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
>> Howard: Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
>> Bernadette: Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
>> Howard: All right, all right.
>> Raj: Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
>> Howard: Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.
>> Raj: Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.
>> Howard: Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?
>> Raj: That’s what he said to me.
>> Leonard: Here you are, Mother.
>> Leonard: I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
>> Leonard: Yeah, special, like that. (Knock on door) That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.
>> Sheldon: All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
>> Leonard: Hey, guys, come on in.
>> Sheldon: Hello.
>> Sheldon: So, did you defile my mother or not?
>> Sheldon: Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
>> Leonard: You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
>> Sheldon: Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
>> Penny: All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
>> Penny: I thought it was really funny.
>> Penny: Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
>> Sheldon: A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
>> Leonard: Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
>> Sheldon: What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
>> Leonard: Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.
>> Sheldon: What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
>> Leonard: Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
>> Sheldon: Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?
>> Leonard: This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
>> Sheldon: But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
>> Leonard: Fine, then you go.
>> Leonard: That still leaves me here with him.
>> Sheldon: Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it.
>> Amy: Who’s ready for a wedding?
>> Sheldon: Great, now I have to start all over.
>> Penny: Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
>> Penny: Well, I learned from the best.
>> Penny: Aw.
>> Leonard: Hello.
>> Penny: Hey.
>> Leonard: Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
>> Amy: Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
>> Sheldon: You made God sad today, Mom.
>> Amy: Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.
>> Sheldon: Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.
>> Amy: It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
>> Sheldon: Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.
>> Howard: Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
>> Raj: Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
>> Howard: That’s really stupid advice.
>> Raj: You know that hurts my feelings.
>> Howard: Calm down, try not to think about it.
>> Raj: Okay. 
>> Howard: Why do I bother talking to you?
>> Raj: Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
>> Howard: I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?
>> Raj: Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.
>> Howard: What’s the point of that story?
>> Raj: I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
>> Leonard: And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?
>> Penny: Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
>> Bernadette: Okay, I think we’re ready.
>> Sheldon: Why do people cry at weddings?
>> Bernadette: We’re here today to celebrate love.
>> Bernadette: Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
>> Sheldon: Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
>> Bernadette: Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.
>> Howard: At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
>> Bernadette: Howard.
>> Penny: Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
>> Leonard: Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t
>> Penny: Oh.
>> Bernadette: Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
>> Bernadette: Thank you. All right, let’s continue.
>> Sheldon: Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.
>> Amy: It’s happening.
>> Sheldon: Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. 
>> Penny: Oh.
>> Leonard: Thank you.
>> Bernadette: Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
>> Leonard: Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.
>> Leonard: That’s okay. I can make it over.
>> Leonard: That was almost a minute.
>> Amy: You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
>> Sheldon: Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
>> Sheldon: Yes ma’am.
>> Amy: Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.
>> Sheldon: Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.
>> Amy: I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
>> Sheldon: What, you’re not my mother.
>> Sheldon: Yes ma’am.
>> Penny: Oh, thanks, Mom.
>> Penny: Is he? I never noticed.
