>> Leonard: So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
>> Leonard: Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
>> Leonard: If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store.
>> Leonard: Oh, good God.
>> Sheldon: In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
>> Leonard: Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?
>> Raj: I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air.
>> Howard: Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.
>> Raj: Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
>> Leonard: No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
>> Raj: Damn, there’s always a catch.
>> Leonard: Hey, Leslie.
>> Sheldon: The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
>> Sheldon: Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person.
>> Sheldon: That is the prevailing opinion.
>> Howard: Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System.
>> Sheldon: Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.
>> Howard: Woof.
>> Sheldon: The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
>> Sheldon: It’s what I do.
>> Howard: You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.
>> Sheldon: I don’t drink coffee.
>> Howard: I do. I love me a cup of joe.
>> Sheldon: I do eat dinner.
>> Sheldon: I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
>> Leonard: Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
>> Sheldon: Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
>> Sheldon: That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.
>> Sheldon: What a nice girl.
>> Howard: Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
>> Sheldon: Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
>> Penny: Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order. (Picking up out of order sign) See? Sorry.
>> Penny: Where you going?
>> Penny: Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
>> Penny: Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
>> Penny: Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
>> Penny: Sheldon Cooper?
>> Leonard: Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
>> Leonard: Uh, the kitchen’s fine. (To Penny) Hey, what are you doing?
>> Penny: I need to see this.
>> Leonard: Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.
>> Sheldon: Oh, hello.
>> Sheldon: Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
>> Sheldon: My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
>> Leonard: Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.
>> Howard: To watch, right?
>> Leonard: No, come on, now, we’re going out.
>> Penny: Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet.
>> Leonard: Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.
>> Leonard: What do you mean “deal”?
>> Penny: You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
>> Leonard: Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
>> Penny: Come on, everybody has a deal.
>> Howard: Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis.
>> Penny: I’m sorry?
>> Howard: I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
>> Leonard: On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
>> Penny: Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
>> Leonard: Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
>> Penny: What are you guys gonna do?
>> Leonard: Uh…
>> Howard: My mom’s making a brisket tonight.
>> Leonard: The one with the little onions? Mmm.
>> Penny: Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight.
>> Howard: Her loss. Let’s go.
>> Raj: Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
>> Leonard: Don’t.
>> Leonard: Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?
>> Sheldon: Yes.
>> Leonard: Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
>> Sheldon: Not in these pants.
>> Leonard: So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?
>> Sheldon: Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.
>> Sheldon: Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
>> Sheldon: Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
>> Sheldon: You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.
>> Leonard: Touche.
>> Leonard: Ah, hey Leslie.
>> Sheldon: Oh, good one.
>> Leonard: Wait for me.
>> Sheldon: Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.
>> Sheldon: Aren’t I?
>> Penny: Hey, guys, this package came for y…
>> Sheldon: Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles
>> Penny: Sorry. (Puts package down and leaves. In hallway, shudders)  Holy crap on a cracker.
>> Leonard: Hey, Penny.
>> Penny: Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there.
>> Leonard: Why? What are they doing?
>> Penny: You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.
>> Leonard: Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?
>> Sheldon: Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.
>> Sheldon: Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>
>> Sheldon: He did.
>> Sheldon: Me. Sorry, Leonard.
>> Leonard: Seriously? You’re not coming?
>> Sheldon: You heard her. How can I argue with me?
>> Leonard: Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.
>> Sheldon: I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
>> Sheldon: He does on Wednesdays.
>> Sheldon: He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
>> Sheldon: Drat.
>> Sheldon: I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. (Pause) I guess I can wait for the DVD. (Pause) And then never ever watch it.
>> Penny: Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
>> Sheldon: Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.
>> Penny: Get rid of her how?
>> Sheldon: I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.
>> Penny: Excuse me?
>> Sheldon: I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
>> Penny: Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
>> Sheldon: Hide me.
>> Penny: Hide you?
>> Sheldon: I formally request sanctuary.
>> Sheldon: Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.
>> Penny: Oh, man.
>> Penny: Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?
>> Penny: Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it.
>> Penny: Oh, gee, okay.
>> Penny: Yeah, he’s a gift all right.
>> Penny: Um, sure, sisters. (Ramona leaves.) Holy crap on a cracker.
>> Leonard: Sheldon? (Pause, then more tapping) What are you doing?!
>> Sheldon: It’s Morse code.
>> Leonard: Why?
>> Sheldon: So we can communicate through the wall.
>> Leonard: We are communicating through the wall.
>> Sheldon: Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.
>> Leonard: I don’t know Morse code.
>> Sheldon: It’s very simple. This is A (knock knock) this is B (knock knock-knock-knock) this is C…
>> Leonard: Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!
>> Sheldon: All right.
>> Leonard: Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t (Sheldon enters) Aw! What’s going on?
>> Sheldon: Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
>> Leonard: I know. When is she going home?
>> Sheldon: Never, that’s the problem. I need your help.
>> Leonard: What are you talking about?
>> Sheldon: I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
>> Leonard: That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
>> Sheldon: Come on! Don’t nitpick!
>> Leonard: Good night.
>> Sheldon: Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.
>> Leonard: The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
>> Sheldon: Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here.
>> Sheldon: Now! Do it!
>> Sheldon: Godzilla clause?
>> Leonard: Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
>> Sheldon: Rats.
>> Sheldon: And I could not have done it without you.
>> Sheldon: It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?
>> Sheldon: Who’s Nowitzki?
>> Sheldon: Oh, you want me to share credit?
>> Sheldon: Get out!
>> Penny: Oh, hey, hi.
>> Penny: Sisters?
>> Sheldon: Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler.
>> Sheldon: Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
>> Sheldon: What a nice girl.
>> Leonard: Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
>> Sheldon: Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll.
>> Sheldon: More Pad Thai, please.
>> Howard: Sheldon, you’ve already had four servings.
>> Raj: You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
>> Sheldon: Just one more bite.
>> Leonard: Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
>> Sheldon: I’m just so… full.
>> Leonard: That’s it. No more Thai food.
