>> Raj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.
>> Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
>> Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
>> Howard: Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s Bar-Mitzvah party. 
>> Leonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. 
>> Sheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. 
>> Leonard: Sheldon, let it go.
>> Sheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. 
>> Howard: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. 
>> Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders. 
>> Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”
>> Leonard: Hello Penny.
>> Howard: Morning ma’am. 
>> Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?
>> Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.
>> Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.
>> Leonard: A party? 
>> Penny: Yeah.
>> Howard: A boy-girl party?
>> Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll have some beer, do a little dancing…
>> Sheldon: Dancing?
>> Leonard: Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…
>> Sheldon: The thing is, we’re not….
>> Leonard: We’re really more….
>> Sheldon: No.
>> Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
>> Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween.
>> Sheldon: A Halloween party?
>> Howard: As in, costumes? 
>> Penny: Well, yeah. 
>> Leonard: Is there a theme?
>> Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween.
>> Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? 
>> Penny: As usual, I’m not following.
>> Leonard: He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…
>> Penny: Sure.
>> Sheldon: What about comic-books?
>> Penny: Fine.
>> Sheldon: Anime?
>> Penny: Of course.
>> Sheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…
>> Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. 
>> Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
>> Leonard: Oh, no. 
>> Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)
>> Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!
>> Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. 
>> Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
>> Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. 
>> Howard: No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. 
>> Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?
>> Leonard: I call Frodo!
>> Leonard: You went with Thor?
>> Raj: What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect. 
>> Howard: I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood. 
>> Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man. 
>> Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
>> Sheldon: I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect. 
>> Leonard: No, it’s not…
>> Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!
>> Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. 
>> Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
>> Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. 
>> Sheldon: Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. 
>> Leonard: All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork. 
>> Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. 
>> Leonard: Hey, sorry we’re late. 
>> Penny: Late? It’s 7:05.
>> Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven. 
>> Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. 
>> Sheldon: It’s 7:05. 
>> Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. 
>> Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?
>> Penny: Probably, but in their own homes. 
>> Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start? 
>> Penny: The parade?
>> Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.
>> Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes. 
>> Sheldon: This party is just going to suck. 
>> Penny: No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so cute.
>> Leonard: Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…
>> Howard: I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
>> Penny: No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be.
>> Leonard: Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect.
>> Sheldon: Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
>> Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. 
>> Leonard: Okay. 
>> Sheldon: See, people get it. 
>> Raj: Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix. 
>> Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these tights. 
>> Sheldon: I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? 
>> Leonard: We’re socialising. Meeting new people. 
>> Sheldon: Telepathically?
>> Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s.
>> Leonard: She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat.
>> Sheldon: And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
>> Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough. 
>> Raj: What is your move?
>> Howard: I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together.
>> Leonard: Where do you get this stuff?
>> Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. 
>> Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. 
>> Howard: If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat.
>> Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
>> Leonard: I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people. 
>> Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.
>> Leonard: How so?
>> Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. 
>> Leonard: Go on.
>> Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”
>> Leonard: Then what happens?
>> Sheldon: That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
>> Leonard: This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in.
>> Sheldon: Good luck. 
>> Leonard: No, you’re coming with me.
>> Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. 
>> Leonard: Come on.
>> Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?
>> Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.
>> Sheldon: Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. 
>> Leonard: Hi.
>> Sheldon: Hello.
>> Sheldon: Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
>> Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
>> Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
>> Sheldon: I’m the Doppler Effect. 
>> Leonard: Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
>> Leonard: Because I’m Frodo.
>> Sheldon: Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect. 
>> Leonard: Oh no.
>> Sheldon: What?
>> Leonard: That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.
>> Sheldon: What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
>> Leonard: If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him.
>> Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now. 
>> Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).
>> Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis. 
>> Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends. 
>> Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. 
>> Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.
>> Sheldon: Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is. 
>> Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
>> Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. 
>> Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down. 
>> Sheldon: True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
>> Leonard: No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face. 
>> Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?
>> Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
>> Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?
>> Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. 
>> Sheldon: Yet another child left behind. 
>> Leonard: No, I’m a Hobbit.
>> Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. 
>> Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. 
>> Leonard: I think we’re all talking to Penny here.
>> Sheldon: I’m not. No offence. 
>> Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice.
>> Penny: Kurt!
>> Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery. 
>> Penny: Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard? 
>> Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. 
>> Sheldon: If he understands that, you’re in trouble. 
>> Sheldon: You’re in trouble. 
>> Penny: Okay, Kurt, please.
>> Leonard: No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
>> Leonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
>> Leonard: I think I’ve made my point.
>> Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. 
>> Leonard: There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
>> Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant. 
>> Penny: I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down. 
>> Sheldon: He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back. 
>> Penny: Leonard, are you okay.
>> Leonard: Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so….
>> Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. 
>> Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. 
>> Leonard: What’s that?
>> Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
>> Leonard: No.
>> Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had. 
>> Leonard: Good night Sheldon.
>> Sheldon: Good night Leonard. 
>> Leonard: Hi Penny.
>> Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.
>> Leonard: I’m fine. 
>> Penny: I’m so sorry about what happened.
>> Leonard: It’s not your fault.
>> Penny: Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. 
>> Leonard: So why was he at your party?
>> Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to… (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.)
>> Leonard: There there. 
>> Penny: God, what is wrong with me.
>> Leonard: Nothing, you’re perfect.
>> Penny: Gah, I’m not perfect.
>> Leonard: Yes you are. 
>> Penny: You really think so, don’t you? (She kisses hm.)
>> Leonard: Penny?
>> Penny: Yeah. 
>> Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?
>> Penny: Just…. a lot. 
>> Leonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?
>> Penny: It might. Boy, you’re really smart.
>> Leonard: Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius. 
>> Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you? 
>> Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive. 
>> Penny: I should probably go.
>> Leonard: Probably. 
>> Leonard: That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)
>> Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)
>> Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?
>> Sheldon: He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. 
>> Howard: He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original Norse God. 
>> Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification. 
>> Howard: I’m supposed to give him a ride home.
>> Sheldon: Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer.
