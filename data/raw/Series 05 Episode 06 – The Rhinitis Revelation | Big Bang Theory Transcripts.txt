>> Leonard: So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
>> Sheldon: Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.
>> Leonard: What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
>> Sheldon: Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.
>> Sheldon: The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.
>> Sheldon: Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
>> Leonard: Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook.
>> Sheldon: Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
>> Sheldon: Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
>> Leonard: All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street.
>> Sheldon: There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
>> Leonard: Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person.
>> Sheldon: Told you.
>> Sheldon: Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
>> Leonard: What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
>> Sheldon: The prospect of fried chicken.
>> Leonard: Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.
>> Leonard: Yeah, yeah, that, too.
>> Sheldon: Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.
>> Leonard: It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.
>> Leonard: Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.
>> Sheldon: And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it.
>> Leonard: Please pester her. Please, for me.
>> Leonard: So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?
>> Sheldon: I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
>> Leonard: Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
>> Sheldon: Get them before they get us.
>> Leonard: Raj, what are you doing?
>> Raj: I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.
>> Sheldon: Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.
>> Raj: Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
>> Leonard: We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list.
>> Raj: Nothing, I’m fine.
>> Raj: No. (Bursts into tears)
>> Raj: I’m so lonely.
>> Sheldon: Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.
>> Sheldon: Offer them a hot beverage.
>> Sheldon: Coffee.
>> Raj: I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
>> Sheldon: I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?
>> Leonard: You want some Oreos?
>> Sheldon: Double Stuf?
>> Leonard: No, regular.
>> Sheldon: Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
>> Sheldon: I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.
>> Sheldon: Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
>> Sheldon: It is nice, isn’t it?
>> Penny: Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.
>> Sheldon: It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.
>> Penny: Good, good.
>> Penny: Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there.
>> Penny: Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
>> Sheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.
>> Penny: Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?
>> Sheldon: Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
>> Howard: So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.
>> Howard: Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.
>> Howard: Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still.
>> Sheldon: I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.
>> Sheldon: What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
>> Penny: Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.
>> Howard: What do you say?
>> Sheldon: What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.
>> Leonard: These are delicious.
>> Leonard: Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
>> Sheldon: Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.
>> Sheldon: Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.
>> Sheldon: But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
>> Sheldon: I’m not going, and you can’t make me.
>> Sheldon: Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind.
>> Leonard: I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
>> Sheldon: I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
>> Sheldon: We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.
>> Leonard: Sorry. Syrup.
>> Sheldon: All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard’s hand)
>> Leonard: I hadn’t…
>> Sheldon: That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)
>> Amy: Are you getting sick?
>> Sheldon: No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.
>> Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?
>> Sheldon: No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.
>> Amy: Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
>> Sheldon: Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.
>> Amy: Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else.
>> Sheldon: Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
>> Amy: Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?
>> Sheldon: Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?
>> Leonard: Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.
>> Penny: This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
>> Leonard: What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
>> Penny: Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?
>> Howard: Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.
>> Leonard: Oh, I’m not sure we should.
>> Penny: Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.
>> Leonard: Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great.
>> Howard: Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames.
>> Howard: He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
>> Howard: No, you only get one wish.
>> Sheldon: Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants.
>> Penny: Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.
>> Leonard: Here.
>> Sheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. (Sneezes)
>> Sheldon: I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living.
>> Sheldon: Okay.
>> Sheldon: And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.
>> Sheldon: Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
>> Sheldon: Thanks, Mom.You’re the best.
>> Sheldon: I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.
>> Sheldon: Yours.
>> Sheldon: No, we don’t. The one we have works great.
>> Sheldon: Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler.
>> Sheldon: Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
>> Sheldon: Get out!
>> Sheldon: Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.
>> Sheldon: What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.
