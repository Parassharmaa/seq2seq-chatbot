>> Penny: Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes.
>> Sheldon: Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
>> Penny: You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?
>> Sheldon: No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
>> Leonard: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
>> Sheldon: Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
>> Penny: I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
>> Leonard: We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
>> Penny: Really? Why not?
>> Leonard: Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
>> Penny: Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?
>> Leonard: Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
>> Penny: Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
>> Sheldon: Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
>> Penny: So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
>> Sheldon: I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
>> Penny: What is it?
>> Sheldon: You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
>> Penny: Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.
>> Sheldon: Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.
>> Leonard: Here we go.
>> Sheldon: December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
>> Leonard: Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
>> Sheldon: I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.
>> Penny: No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
>> Sheldon: No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
>> Leonard: No, he doesn’t.
>> Sheldon: I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
>> Leonard: Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.
>> Sheldon: Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you.
>> Penny: What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?
>> Leonard: Tomorrow.
>> Penny: When were you going to tell me?
>> Leonard: Um, tomorrow?
>> Penny: Why were you keeping this a secret?
>> Leonard: Well, I just, I thought…
>> Sheldon: If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.
>> Penny: Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.
>> Leonard: You are, it’s just…
>> Sheldon: If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
>> Penny: Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts.
>> Leonard: I know. And those specials, they change every day.
>> Penny: Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on.
>> Leonard: Okay, sorry.
>> Penny: So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
>> Leonard: Um…
>> Penny: You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?
>> Leonard: Um…
>> Penny: Why not?
>> Leonard: Um…
>> Sheldon: Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
>> Sheldon: No trouble at all.
>> Leonard: I drove, Mother. I’m driving now.
>> Sheldon: My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
>> Leonard: Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
>> Sheldon: August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
>> Sheldon: You did.
>> Sheldon: Neither do I, but it’s the social convention.
>> Leonard: Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?
>> Leonard: No, I heard that.
>> Leonard: I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
>> Sheldon: It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
>> Leonard: Fine, Mom. How are you?
>> Leonard: Now I’m less fine.
>> Leonard: No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?
>> Sheldon: My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
>> Leonard: You must be very happy.
>> Sheldon: Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…
>> Leonard: Not the time, Sheldon.
>> Sheldon: Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
>> Sheldon: Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.
>> Howard: What? No.
>> Howard: Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
>> Howard: No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
>> Howard: She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
>> Howard: Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.
>> Leonard: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
>> Howard: What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
>> Leonard: All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
>> Howard: Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist.
>> Leonard: Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
>> Penny: Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no.
>> Howard: If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts.
>> Leonard: What?
>> Leonard: No!
>> Penny: No, it sounded like a compliment.
>> Leonard: When did this happen?
>> Sheldon: September 22nd.
>> Leonard: Mitzy’s dead?
>> Sheldon: She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
>> Leonard: I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
>> Leonard: You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!
>> Penny: Nothing. Not a damn thing.
>> Penny: Oh, it’s not a problem.
>> Penny: No, you do not.
>> Penny: Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.
>> Penny: Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?
>> Penny: Sure, sure.
>> Penny: Eight years?
>> Penny: Yikes. What’s so funny?
>> Penny: You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
>> Penny: I do, I’ll teach you.
>> Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?
>> Leonard: What is it?
Sheldon: I made tea.
>> Leonard: I don’t want tea.
>> Sheldon: I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
>> Leonard: Then why are you telling me?
>> Sheldon: It’s a conversation starter.
>> Leonard: That’s a lousy conversation starter.
>> Sheldon: Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.
>> Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?
>> Sheldon: What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
>> Leonard: I want that too. Why are you here?
>> Sheldon: To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
>> Leonard: Thank you, that’s very comforting.
>> Sheldon: That’s not the comforting part.
>> Leonard: It’s not?
>> Sheldon: No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
>> Leonard: You’re right, I do feel better.
>> Sheldon: Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.
>> Leonard: You’re my surrogate family?
>> Sheldon: If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night.
>> Penny: Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.
>> Penny: I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
>> Penny: As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine.
>> Penny: Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.
>> Penny: Hey, Bev, guess what?
>> Penny: I’m sleeping with your son.
>> Penny: The one from whom I live across the hall from.
>> Penny: Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis.
>> Penny: Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.
>> Penny: Well, let’s go find out who.
>> Penny: Leonard?
>> Penny: Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
>> Leonard: What the hell is going on?
>> Penny: You’re in trouble.
>> Penny: Yeah, not bad, not bad.
>> Leonard: Are you guys drunk?
>> Penny: Oh, thank you.
>> Penny: What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
>> Leonard: How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
>> Leonard: I do.
>> Penny: That’s the Del Taco.
>> Sheldon: Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
>> Sheldon: You’re very welcome.
>> Leonard: Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here.
>> Sheldon: I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
>> Sheldon: I blame Penny.
>> Penny: I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.
>> Leonard: Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
>> Sheldon: Agreed.
>> Penny: Agreed.
>> Leonard: What the hell, agreed.
>> Penny: Oh, thank you, Beverly.
>> Leonard: Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?
>> Leonard: I’m over it.
